            WebJam is a week-long event where students come together to create
            fully functional web applications. Whether you&apos;ve never heard
            of web applications or built many, WebJam is here to give you a
            platform to learn, build, and create!
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past 4 years, WebJam has focused on encouraging beginners
            and people who are curious about web technologies â€” from frontend to
            backend! Our goal is to provide learning and networking
            opportunities for our community of developers, especially ones that
            come from underrepresented backgrounds in the tech space.
